## Hi there 👋
🌱 I am currently studying of Industrial Information Technology at LAB university in Lahti 

I am interested on new technologies and sustaniability. However I dont have a backround of studies in this field.

When I had some searching in UX/UI design and find fascinating what you can create and what is behind the scenes of every website and app we navegate everyday. 

Now I am interest in learning and practice my solving problem skills; reasoning thinking and IT skills.

My hobbies include: Tennis, reading, trekking, movies, wellbeing, dancing, and exploring the science behind cooking.

🤩 UX/UI project: (https://www.behance.net/gallery/142882115/Emigram/modules/807250297)<!--
This project aims to create an app designed to support Venezuelan immigrants living in Peru. The app will help them connect with the Venezuelan community and assist small businesses and professionals in attracting customers and clients. While this is the initial concept, it can be adapted and expanded to suit immigrants in other countries. For example, any other immigrants in Finland might use the app to find information about residence permits, locate nearby restaurants, or establish a communication channel with fellow nationals.
